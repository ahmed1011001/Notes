        <h2>Is the egg the most Extraordinary Fortress anywhere?</h2>
        <p>
          It began, as many thought exercises do, with a discussion in the
          kitchen. My wife and I were debating whether a cooked egg was still
          safe to eat after spending the night on the kitchen counter. I am not
          someone who throws away food lightly. Confidently, I told her the egg
          would be fine. After all, eggshells are made of calcium carbonate,
          solid, sealed, and, in my mind, impenetrable to any contaminants.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turned out to be one of those “smart dumb” moments. By the end of
          this journey, I would learn how spectacularly wrong I was, and how
          remarkable life is at engineering security.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background is in sterile large molecule manufacturing, the kind of
          work where even a single microscopic breach within thousands of
          gaskets and kilometres of stainless steel can trigger an investigation
          lasting months or even years. I have spent much of my career designing
          systems to keep contaminants out and tracing them when they find a way
          in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet for all the effort, precision, and technology we pour into
          sterility, nothing I’ve seen in industry compares to what nature
          achieves effortlessly inside an egg. To keep things simple, I focused
          on one scenario. An unfertilised, intact chicken egg.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I went down the rabbit hole of Eggsecurity, I discovered that the
          egg is an astonishingly well-designed fortress. Before diving into the
          details, it is worth noting just how nutrient-rich an egg truly is. It
          is so abundant in life-sustaining material that even today, many
          biopharmaceutical products are made using eggs. To a bacterium,
          reaching the egg yolk must be like winning the lottery. The yolk’s
          purpose, after all, is to nourish life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first question was simple: are eggshells porous? It turns out they
          are not only porous, but they contain thousands of microscopic
          openings. The average pore size is in the single-digit μm range. That
          may sound tiny, but it is still large enough for a small bacterium to
          pass through. For context, sterile filtration uses filters with pores
          as small as 0.2 μm. I even know some aseptic subject matter experts
          who would argue for 0.1 μm, to ensure nothing microbial gets through.
          The benchmark for this comes from the smallest known bacterium used to
          test filter integrity, <em>Brevundimonas diminuta</em>, with a rod like
          shape and diameter of 0.5 to 0.8 μm. This organism is introduced at
          high concentrations (107 Colony Forming Units/cm2) to challenge the
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          My next question was what is meant to pass through these pores? The
          answer was so obvious how could I have missed this. Biology 101 a good
          exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide is required for an embryo to
          grow. So the egg must allow certain molecules to pass while keeping
          everything else out. The real question became: how?
        </p>
        <p>
          The first protective barrier is the antimicrobial cuticle, a thin
          outer coating that acts like a natural sealant. Whether it remains
          intact or is partially washed away, it is the egg’s first line of
          defence. In countries where eggs are washed, this layer does not
          vanish instantly, so for a certain duration it will still provides
          some antimicrobial protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath it lies the eggshell with thousands of microscopic pores.
          These tunnels are not straight shafts but winding labyrinths, long and
          twisted to prevent easy entry. The environment inside is dry, which
          makes bacterial movement nearly impossible. Another element is that
          the eggshell environment will not be nutrient reach meaning it will be
          difficult for the contaminates to grow through the tunnel which is
          another mean of transport for contaminants. Microbes thrive in
          moisture and nutrient rich environment. In a dry maze without air
          currents or nutrients, they would have to perform the microbial
          equivalent of cave exploration whilst immobilised and starving in
          search of a hidden treasure.

          />
          <figcaption>
            Each labeled layer forms part of the egg’s multi-tiered security
            system.

        </figure>
        <p>
          Beyond the shell lies the outer membrane, another fibrous layer armed
          with antimicrobial molecules. Between the outer and inner membranes
          lies an air gap, which provides yet another layer of protection. This
          gap presents a challenge to bacteria, like a ravine without a bridge.
          I do imagine the outer membrane has more nutrients than the eggshell,
          meaning a bacterial colony could grow a bridge by consuming and
          multiplying within it. The inner membrane that follows presents
          another barrier equipped with antimicrobial defences.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then, the egg white. Now it’s party time, right? We have made it
          to the promised land. Not quite yet. Let’s assume it took a while for
          the bacteria to make it this far. Over time, the egg white’s pH
          increases. If it took the bacteria a week to breach the earlier
          defences, the pH could be around 9, which is far from ideal for
          bacterial growth. On top of that, the egg white contains numerous
          antimicrobial components, giving it the equivalent of a Batman utility
          belt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should a bacterium somehow survive all that, it must still breach one
          final layer, the vitelline membrane, before going down the straight
          and reaching the yolk. The yolk, with its rich golden hue, is the
          prize. A nutrient dense reservoir optimised for life itself, filled
          with proteins and fats. For any microbe, it is paradise.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, back to the question: was the cooked egg safe after a night on the
          counter? At first glance, it seemed likely. After all, that fortress
          sounded impenetrable. But there was a fatal flaw: cooking. Heat
          denatures most of those antimicrobial proteins, leaving only structure
          behind. As the egg cools, the contraction of the contents will create
          an underpass and draw in external air and with it, potential
          contaminants.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought to myself as I have many times at work, do not underestimate
          the cunningness of a contaminate. Then I had an aha moment and
          realised I didn’t need to even perform this thought excercise. Since
          this particular egg had a hole pierced into its shell for the egg
          cooker compromising the majority of the security layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on it, I realised the egg might be the most extraordinary
          natural security system ever created. Each layer has its weaknesses,
          the cuticle can be washed away, the shell can absorb moisture
          depending on humidity, the membranes can age, and the albumen only
          slows rather than kills but the brilliance lies in their independence.
          If one layer fails, the others remain functional. This is redundancy
          in its purest, most elegant form.
        </p>
        <p>
          It reminds me of engineered systems that boast layers of protection
          yet crumble when one component fails. We see it in news stories about
          the recent Louvre heists where a couple of weak points led to breach.
          The egg, on the other hand, does not rely on a chain where one broken
          link brings collapse. It is a network of independent defences, each
          designed to operate independently. What is even crazier when you think
          about it is this is all done without any energy. Once the egg has been
          laid that’s it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, the lesson I drew from this is that environments for
          people should be like the egg yolk rich, supportive, and full of
          growth potential. Around them should exist layers of protection,
          invisible but resilient, shielding them from harm. For bad actors, the
          system should feel like the egg’s layered fortress: intricate,
          unyielding, and nearly impossible to penetrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Easier said than done, of course. But if nature can engineer such a
          perfect fortress, surely we can strive to do the same for the worlds
          we build against bad actors.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would be curious on your thoughts or if I made some wrong
          assumptions. I am especially interested in hearing from egg
          specialists!
